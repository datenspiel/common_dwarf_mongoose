### Connect to MongoDB with Common Dwarf Mongoose

Common Dwarf Mongoose is by now just a simple wrapper around Mongoose.
Therefore connecting to a MongoDB is done via Mongoose.

```coffeescript
mongo = require('mongoose')

mongo.connect('mongodb://localhost/my_database')
mongo.connection.on("open",()->
  console.log "opened"
)

```
